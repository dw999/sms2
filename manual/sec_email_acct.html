      Your email account used for SMS operation is very important for your privacy and safety. If it is uncovered by government agents, you are highly possible to
      force hand over your SMS messages to them. If your email account is broken in by hackers, they could have chance to access your SMS messages also.<br>
      <br>
      To harden and hide your email account, below is a best practice guideline: <br>
      <br>
      <table class=table width=100% cellspacing=1 cellpedding=1>
      <tr class=content>
        <td width=10px valign=top>1.</td>
        <td>
          Don't use email application to access your email account, always use web browser for it. i.e. Your email service must be web accessible, like Gmail,
          Hotmail or Yahoo mail. Otherwise, you email account could be found by government agents easily from your smartphone or computer.
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>

      <tr>
        <td width=10px valign=top>2.</td>
        <td>
          Always fully purge all SMS related email records after use. i.e. Not just delete them, you should also remove them from the 'trash box'.   
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>

      <tr>
        <td width=10px valign=top>3.</td>
        <td>
          Always clear web browser history after access your email account. The most convenient way for it is to use DuckDuckGo or Brave browser access your email 
          account to get the SMS login mail, then use the same browser to access SMS messaging site. Therefore, as you click the "fire" button on DuckDuckGo or quit
          Brave browser, entire web surfing history will be cleared.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Note: If your SMS connection mode is 0 or 3, i.e. you login SMS via a one time email linkage, use 'open link in new tab' on the same browser to access 
          your SMS messaging site, so that you can delete and purge the mail record on your email account, and then logout your email account.</b>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>

      <tr>
        <td width=10px valign=top>4.</td>
        <td>
          Set a strong and easily remember password for your email account. It sounds contradiction, but everyone should have a series of digits, symbols and/or
          sentence which have special meaning to him/her. Of course, your password should avoid to use your phone number, birthday, citizen ID, address, etc.

      </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      <b>Remark:</b><br>
      If you find unrecognised (it means you don't know or remember) SMS access mail record, or messaging site access link is invalid before timeout, it is a
      warning signal for you that your email or SMS account may be compromised. So, you should change the password of your email account, inform SMS system 
      administrator to lock your SMS account, or abandon your SMS account by login it with unhappy password.
