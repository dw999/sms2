      Delete feature function is used to physically delete your feature icon file, program file, and related database table(s), not just hide it from the
      first page on the login decoy site. This process is irreversible, so please use it with care.<br>
      <br>
      Clicking on the 'cross' image of the feature you wanted to delete from the feature list (figure 6.1.3), screen like figure 6.4.1 will be displayed.
      In there, the feature icon image and program file name will be shown. If your feature is database related and you want to remove all tables which
      are no longer needed, you should create a SQL command script file to drop those tables, and input it on the field for SQL script file. Then, you may
      click the button 'Delete' to proceed. You will then be asked twice to confirm the deletion. If you select 'OK' on both confirmation dialog boxes, the
      system will delete the feature.<br>
      <br>
      If everything is OK, you will be redirected to the feature list. Otherwise, error message will be shown and you will return to delete feature screen.

      function cannot help you to remove them.
