      Now, there are just two features are provided for your login decoy site as you install your SMS server, it is far from enough to fool government agents.
      So, if you know web development with Perl and jQuery mobile, you can build new features for your login decoy site to make it look more like a real
      business site. And hopefully, you could share your created feature(s) to the community, so that I could embed your work into future version of SMS
      server.<br>
      <br>
      To make a new SMS decoy site feature, you must bear in mind it has one restriction: The new feature must be put on one program file. And you also need
      to prepare a JPEG image icon file for your new feature, the image file size should be 50KB or less. If your new feature involve database operations, you
      may also need to prepare an optional SQL command file to create all data table(s) you needed. Please study '/www/pdatools/cgi-pl/tools/notes.pl' and
      '/www/pdatools/cgi-pl/tools/scheduler.pl' when you build your own feature.<br>
      <br>
      After you develop your Perl program, prepare associated JPEG image icon (may be a SQL command file to update decoy site database schema is also needed),
      you can add it into the SMS decoy site by clicking the 'Add feature' button on the feature list (figure 6.1.3). Then screen like figure 6.2.1 will be
      displayed.

      Click on button 'Choose file' of icon and program file input fields to select files of the icon image and Perl script files respectively. If the new
      feature is database operations related, you may also need to provide a SQL script file to create related table(s), indexes, etc. If you want the newly
      added feature to be activated on the decoy login site, set 'Assign to Feature List' to 'On', and then input a sorting order number to it (figure 6.2.2).
      Otherwise, you may leave it on 'Off' status. Then, you could click 'Save' button to add the new feature to login decoy site.<br>
      <br>
      If everything is OK, you will be redirected to the feature list again. If something is wrong, error message will be shown, and you will return to the
      feature adding page.

      <b>Remark:</b><br>
      If any new javascript library files and/or image file(s) is/are required by your new feature, please put javascript library files and image files to
      directories '/www/pdatools/js' and '/www/pdatools/images' respectively. This function cannot help you to deploy javascript library and image files.
