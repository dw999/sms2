      SMS stands for Secret Messaging System. Just like Whatsapp, Telegram and Signal, it is an instant messaging system, but unlike any of
      them, SMS is a pure web application and runs on all modern web browsers which support HTML5. Since it is a web application, any platform
      with HTML5 supported web browser can be used to access SMS, such as smartphones, tablets, laptop computers and desktop computers. Further more,
      you totally control both client and server side. It means that you need to install and manage SMS server yourself.<br>
      <br>
      You may wonder there are so many free and excellent instant messaging apps out there, why this world needs one more web based instant messaging system?
      Before answer this question, may I ask all of you one question? Is any instant messaging application designed from the ground up for those users who need
      secure communication in dangerous places and situation? For example, could political activists or journalists keep their instant messaging communication
      content safe as their phones or computers are seized by secret police of dictatorial regime? No, none of them. The secret police will find the installed
      instant messaging application and then the messages (either hack into the device/application or torture the user to get the access password), that is why
      a pure web based instant messaging system is made to address this problem. If you follow the best practice of SMS usage on section 5, you could keep your
      privacy in most extreme situation.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, if your messages are not handled by yourself, who can guarantee your privacy won't be abused. So, SMS is made to let you reclaim your privacy,
      your human rights.
